# Exercises: Thread safety

Certainly! Here are some code-based exercises related to making collections thread-safe:

### Simple Code Exercises:
1. **Using `synchronizedList()`**:
   ```java
   // Exercise: Write a Java program that demonstrates how to make an ArrayList thread-safe using synchronizedList().
   ```

2. **Concurrent Modification**:
   ```java
   // Exercise: Create a Java program that simulates concurrent modification exceptions in a non-thread-safe collection like ArrayList.
   // Then modify the program to use synchronizedList() to make the collection thread-safe and prevent the exceptions.
   ```

### Intermediate Code Exercises:
3. **Comparing Performance**:
   ```java
   // Exercise: Write two Java programs that perform a significant number of read and write operations on ArrayList.
   // One program should use synchronizedList(), and the other should use CopyOnWriteArrayList.
   // Measure the execution time of both programs and compare their performance.
   ```

4. **Custom Thread-Safe Collection**:
   ```java
   // Exercise: Design and implement a custom thread-safe collection class in Java.
   // Ensure that the class provides methods for adding, removing, and accessing elements safely from multiple threads.
   // Write a test program to validate the thread safety of your custom collection.
   ```

### Advanced Code Exercises:
5. **Fine-Grained Locking**:
   ```java
   // Exercise: Modify the custom thread-safe collection class from Exercise 4 to use fine-grained locking mechanisms instead of synchronizing the entire collection.
   // Implement strategies like lock striping or per-element locking to achieve better concurrency and performance.
   ```

6. **Concurrency Testing**:
   ```java
   // Exercise: Write a Java program that performs stress testing on a thread-safe collection class (e.g., ConcurrentHashMap).
   // Create multiple threads that concurrently add, remove, and access elements from the collection.
   // Use assertions or other validation techniques to ensure that the collection remains in a consistent state under concurrent access.
   ```

7. **Atomic Operations**:
   ```java
   // Exercise: Implement a Java program that uses atomic operations (e.g., AtomicInteger) to ensure thread safety in a custom collection class.
   // Compare the performance of this approach with traditional synchronization techniques.
   ```

These exercises involve writing Java code to implement, test, and analyze various aspects of making collections thread-safe. They cover basic usage, performance considerations, advanced techniques, and concurrency testing.
