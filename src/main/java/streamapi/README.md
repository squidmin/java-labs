Introduces the Stream API.

The following topics are covered:
- Stream creation
  - a) `Stream.of(v1, v2, v3, ...)`
  - b) `List.stream()`
- The Stream interfaces
  - Intermediate operations
  - Terminal operations

The addition of the `Stream` API was one of the major features added to Java 8. A `Stream` in Java can be defined as a sequence of elements from a source that supports aggregate operations on its elements. The source here refers to collections or arrays that provide data to a stream.

A few important points about streams are:
1. A stream is not a data structure itself. It is a bunch of operations applied to a source. The source can be collections, arrays or I/O channels.
2. Streams donâ€™t change the original data structure.
3. There can be zero or more intermediate operations that transform a stream into another stream.
4. Each intermediate operation is lazily executed (This will be discussed later).
5. Terminal operations produce the result of the stream.

### Stream creation

Streams can be created from different element sources, e.g., a collection or an array with the help of `stream()` and `of()` methods. Below are the different ways to create a stream.

### a) `Stream.of(v1, v2, v3, ...)`

In the below example, we are creating a stream of integers using the `Stream.of()` method.

```java
import java.util.stream.Stream;

public class StreamDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Stream<Integer> stream = Stream.of(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9);
        stream.forEach(p -> System.out.println(p));
    }
}
```

#### Output

```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
```

### b) `List.stream()`

In the below example, we are creating a stream from a `List`.

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.stream.Stream;

public class StreamDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("a");
        list.add("b");
        list.add("c");
        list.add("d");

        Stream<String> stream = list.stream();
        stream.forEach(p -> System.out.println(p));
    }
}
```

#### Output

```
a
b
c
d
```

### The Stream interfaces

The Stream API defines a few interfaces such as `Stream`, `IntStream`, `LongStream`, etc.

The `Stream<T>` interface is for object elements. For primitives, it defines `IntStream`, `LongStream` and `DoubleStream` interfaces.

It is a good practice to use primitive streams if you are dealing with primitives because wrapping primitives to objects and auto-boxing is a costly process.

Below is the complete list of methods defined in Stream API.

The methods defined by these interfaces can be divided into the following two categories:

### Intermediate operations

These methods do not produce any results. They usually accept functional interfaces as parameters and always return a new stream. Some examples of intermediate operations are `filter()`, `map()`, etc.

### Terminal operations

These methods produce some results, e.g., `count()`, `toArray(..)`, and `collect(..)`.

The streams operations can be further classified as:
1. filtering
2. slicing
3. mapping
4. matching and finding
5. reduction
6. collect

This was the basic introduction to streams. In subsequent sections, we will explore each of these operations. We will also look at how these methods are combined to process collections.

The next section discusses the filtering operations in `Stream`.
