# Java Stream API: Overview

The Java Stream API provides a wide range of operations that can be classified into two categories: intermediate operations and terminal operations.
Intermediate operations return a new stream and are typically used to transform or filter data.
Terminal operations produce a result or a side effect and terminate the stream pipeline.
