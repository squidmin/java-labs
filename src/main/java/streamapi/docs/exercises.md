# Stream API exercises

## Exercise 1: Filter even numbers

Write a Java program with a method `List<Integer> filterEvenNumbers(List<Integer> numbers)` that returns each even number in the `numbers` parameter.

## Exercise 2: Sum of squares

Write a Java program with a method `int sumOfSquares(List<Integer> numbers)` that returns the sum of the square of each integer.

## Exercise 3: Count words longer than 5 characters

Write a Java program with a method `long countWordsLongerThanFiveChars(List<String> words)` that returns each word that is longer than 5 characters.

## Exercise 5: Convert strings to uppercase

Write a method that uses the stream API to convert each string in a list of strings to uppercase.

## Exercise 6: Find minimum and maximum numbers

## Exercise 7: Group students by age

## Exercise 8: Flatten nested lists

## Exercise 9: Partition numbers into odd and even

## Exercise 10: Find average age of employees by department

## Exercise 11: Stream creation using `Stream.of()`

Write a Java program that creates a stream of integers using the `Stream.of()` method and prints each element of the stream.

## Exercise 12: Stream creation using `List.stream()`

Write a Java program that creates a list of strings, converts it into a stream using the `List.stream()` method, and prints each element of the stream.

## Exercise 13: Intermediate operation - Filtering

Write a Java program that creates a stream of integers from 1 to 10, filters out the even numbers, and prints the filtered numbers.

## Exercise 14: Intermediate operation - Mapping

Write a Java program that creates a stream of strings representing numbers, converts each string to its corresponding integer value, and prints the integers.

## Exercise 15: Intermediate operation - Slicing

Write a Java program that creates a stream of strings, skips the first two elements, and then prints the remaining elements of the stream.

## Exercise 16: Intermediate operation - Matching and finding

Write a Java program that creates a stream of strings, checks if any element starts with the letter '**A**', and prints the result.

## Exercise 17: Terminal operation - Count

Write a Java program that creates a stream of integers from 1 to 100, counts the number of elements in the stream, and prints the count.

## Exercise 18: Terminal operation - Collect

Write a Java program that creates a stream of strings, collects the elements into a list, and prints the list.

## Exercise 19: Intermediate operation - Chaining

Write a Java program that creates a list of integers, filters out the even numbers, squares each element, and then prints the result.

## Exercise 20: Intermediate and Terminal operations - Combination

Write a Java program that creates a list of strings, filters out the strings starting with the letter '**A**', converts them to uppercase, and collects them into a new list, then prints the new list.
