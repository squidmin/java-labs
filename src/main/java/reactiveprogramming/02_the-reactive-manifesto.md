# The Reactive Manifesto

The Reactive Manifesto outlines the key principles of reactive systems:

- **Responsive**: The system responds in a timely manner if at all possible. Responsiveness is the cornerstone of usability and utility.
- **Resilient**: The system stays responsive in the face of failure. This applies to both system errors and user errors.
- **Elastic**: The system stays responsive under varying workload. Reactive systems can react to changes in the input rate by increasing or decreasing the resources allocated to service these inputs.
- **Message Driven**: Relying on asynchronous message-passing ensures loose coupling, isolation, and location transparency.
