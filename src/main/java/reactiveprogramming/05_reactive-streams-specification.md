# Reactive Streams Specification

The Reactive Streams specification defines a standard for asynchronous stream processing with non-blocking backpressure. It consists of four main interfaces:

- **Publisher**: Produces data and sends it to one or more subscribers.
- **Subscriber**: Consumes data produced by a publisher.
- **Subscription**: Represents a connection between a publisher and a subscriber, allowing the subscriber to request data and cancel the subscription.
- **Processor**: Acts as both a subscriber and a publisher, enabling transformation of data streams.
