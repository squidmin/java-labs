# Overview of Project Reactor

Project Reactor is a library for building reactive applications on the JVM. It provides two main types:

- **Flux**: Represents a reactive sequence of 0 to N items. It can emit zero, one, or many items, and it completes or fails.
- **Mono**: Represents a single asynchronous value or no value at all. It either completes with a value, completes empty, or fails.
