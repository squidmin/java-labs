# Exercises: Generics

## Exercise 1: Introduction to Generics

Write a Java program that demonstrates the use of generics by creating a generic class `Box` that can hold any type of object. Implement methods to set and get the value of the box.

## Exercise 2: Generic Methods

Develop a Java program that showcases the usage of generic methods. Create a method `printArray` that accepts an array of any type and prints its elements.

## Exercise 3: Bounded Type Parameters

Write a Java program that demonstrates bounded type parameters by creating a generic class `Calculator` that accepts only numeric types (such as `Integer`, `Double`, etc.). Implement methods to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Exercise 4: Wildcards

Create a Java program that utilizes wildcards to allow flexibility in method parameters. Implement a method `printList` that accepts a list of any type and prints its elements.

## Exercise 5: Generic Interfaces

Develop a Java program that demonstrates the usage of generic interfaces. Create a generic interface `Comparator<T>` with a method `compare` that compares two objects of type `T`.

## Exercise 6: Generic Inheritance

Write a Java program that showcases generic inheritance. Create a generic superclass `Box<T>` and a subclass `ColoredBox<T>` that adds color information to the box.

## Exercise 7: Advanced Generics with Collections

Develop a Java program that demonstrates advanced generics with collections. Create a method `maxElement` that accepts a list of any comparable type and returns the maximum element.

## Exercise 8: Generics with Multiple Bounds

Create a Java program that demonstrates the usage of generics with multiple bounds. Implement a generic class `Tuple<K, V>` that can hold a key-value pair, where the key extends `Comparable` and the value extends `Serializable`.

## Exercise 9: Type Erasure and Reflection

Write a Java program that explores type erasure and reflection in generics. Create a generic class `Printer<T>` with a method `print` that prints the type of the object passed to it.

## Exercise 10: Generics with Enums and Annotations

Develop a Java program that utilizes generics with enums and annotations. Create a generic class `EnumMap<K extends Enum<K>, V>` that represents a mapping from an enum type to a value.

These exercises cover various aspects of generics in Java, from basic usage to advanced concepts like bounded type parameters, wildcards, generic inheritance, and more.
