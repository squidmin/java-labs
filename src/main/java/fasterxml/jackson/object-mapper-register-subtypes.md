# ObjectMapper `registerSubtypes` method

The `registerSubtypes` method the `ObjectMapper` class in the `com.fasterxml.jackson.databind
 package is used to register subtypes of a base type for polymorphic deserialization.
This method is crucial when working with JSON data that includes objects of various subclasses of a base type, allowing Jackson to correctly identify and deserialize these subclasses.

## Purpose of `registerSubtypes`

The primary purpose of the `registerSubtypes` method is to inform the Jackson `ObjectMapper` about the possible subtypes of a base class.
This enables the `ObjectMapper` to handle polymorphic deserialization, where a JSON property can represent any subtype of a base type.
