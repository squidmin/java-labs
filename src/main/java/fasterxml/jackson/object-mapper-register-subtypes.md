# ObjectMapper `registerSubtypes` method

The `registerSubtypes` method the `ObjectMapper` class in the `com.fasterxml.jackson.databind
 package is used to register subtypes of a base type for polymorphic deserialization.
This method is crucial when working with JSON data that includes objects of various subclasses of a base type, allowing Jackson to correctly identify and deserialize these subclasses.

## Purpose of `registerSubtypes`

The primary purpose of the `registerSubtypes` method is to inform the Jackson `ObjectMapper` about the possible subtypes of a base class.
This enables the `ObjectMapper` to handle polymorphic deserialization, where a JSON property can represent any subtype of a base type.

## Key Concepts

- **Polymorphic Deserialization**: The process of deserializing JSON data into instances of different subclasses of a base class.
- **Type Information**: To support polymorphic deserialization, JSON data often includes type information (e.g., a type identifier) that indicates the specific subtype of an object.

## How It Works

When deserializing JSON data, Jackson can use type information provided in the JSON to determine the appropriate subclass to instantiate.
By registering subtypes with the `registerSubtypes` method, you ensure that Jackson is aware of all possible subclasses it might encounter during deserialization.

## Method Variants

The `registerSubtypes` method has several variants for registering subtypes:

### 1. Registering by Class

```java
public void registerSubtypes(Class<?>... classes)
```

Example:

```java
objectMapper.registerSubtypes(SubType1.class, SubType2.class);
```

### 2. Registering by NamedType:

```java
public void registerSubtypes(NamedType... types)
```

Example:

```java
objectMapper.registerSubtypes(
    new NamedType(SubType1.class, "subType1"),
    new NamedType(SubType2.class, "subType2")
);
```

## Example Usage

Consider a scenario where you have a base class `Animal` and two subclasses `Dog` and `Cat`.
You can use `registerSubtypes` to register these subclasses for polymorphic deserialization.

### Step 1: Define the Classes

```java
import com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonTypeInfo;

@JsonTypeInfo(JsonTypeInfo.Id.NAME, include = JsonTypeInfo.As.PROPERTY, property = "type")
public abstract class Animal {
    public String name;
}

public class Dog extends Animal {
    public double barkVolume;
}

public class Cat extends Animal {
    public int livesLeft;
}
```

### Step 2: Register Subtypes with ObjectMapper

```java
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;

ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();
objectMapper.registerSubtypes(Dog.class, Cat.class);
```

### Step 3: Deserialize JSON Data

```java
String dogJson = "{\"type\":\"Dog\", \"name\":\"Buddy\", \"barkVolume\":10.5}";
String catJson = "{\"type\":\"Cat\", \"name\":\"Whiskers\", \"livesLeft\":7}";

Animal dog = objectMapper.readValue(dogJson, Animal.class);
Animal cat = objectMapper.readValue(catJson, Animal.class);
```

In this example:

- The `Animal` class is the base class with a `JsonTypeInfo` annotation to include type information in the JSON.
- The `Dog` and `Cat` classes are subclasses of `Animal`.
- The `registerSubtypes` method is used to register `Dog` and `Cat` as subtypes.
- The JSON strings `dogJson` and `catJson` are deserialized into `Dog` and `Cat` objects, respectively.

The `registerSubtypes` method of the `ObjectMapper` class in the `com.fasterxml.jackson.databind` package is essential for handling polymorphic deserialization in Jackson.
By registering subtypes, you ensure that the `ObjectMapper` can correctly identify and instantiate the appropriate subclass based on the type information provided in the JSON data.
This method is particularly useful in scenarios where you deal with a hierarchy of classes and need to deserialize JSON data into the correct subclass instances.
