Java 17, released as a Long-Term Support (LTS) version in September 2021, brought several major features and enhancements to the Java language and its standard library. Here are some of the notable features and improvements in Java 17:

1. **Sealed Classes (JEP 409)**:
    - Sealed classes provide a more declarative way to control which other classes or interfaces may extend or implement them. This feature allows developers to define a strict hierarchy of classes, improving maintainability and security by restricting unauthorized subclassing.

2. **Pattern Matching for `switch` (Preview) (JEP 406)**:
    - This feature extends the pattern matching capabilities to the `switch` expression, allowing patterns to be used in case labels. It simplifies coding and reduces error-pronality by avoiding verbose and error-prone type checks and casts.

3. **New macOS Rendering Pipeline (JEP 382)**:
    - A new rendering pipeline for macOS, based on Apple's Metal framework, which replaces the existing pipeline that used the deprecated OpenGL framework. This change improves the performance and efficiency of Java applications running on macOS.

4. **Foreign Function & Memory API (Incubator) (JEP 412)**:
    - An API that allows Java programs to interoperate with code and data outside of the Java runtime. This includes calling native libraries and managing native memory, which is crucial for applications that need to interface with system-level resources or libraries written in other programming languages.

5. **Enhanced Pseudo-Random Number Generators (JEP 356)**:
    - Introduces new interfaces and implementations for pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs), including additional algorithms and the ability to specify an algorithm in a cross-platform manner.

6. **Strong Encapsulation of JDK Internals (JEP 403)**:
    - Stronger encapsulation of Java's internal APIs (such as those in the `sun.misc` package) to prevent their use by external applications. This change encourages developers to use standard APIs and enhances security and maintainability.

7. **Deprecate the Applet API for Removal (JEP 398)**:
    - The Applet API, already mostly obsolete due to browser vendors removing support for Java browser plugins, is formally deprecated and marked for future removal.

8. **Removal of the Experimental AOT and JIT Compiler (JEP 410)**:
    - The experimental Ahead-of-Time (AOT) and Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler, introduced in earlier versions, were removed. This does not affect the main JIT compiler part of the JVM but refers to an additional experimental feature that was never widely adopted.

9. **Deprecate the Security Manager for Removal (JEP 411)**:
    - Marks the Security Manager and associated APIs for deprecation in preparation for their future removal. The Security Manager is a legacy security feature that has been replaced by newer, more flexible security mechanisms.

These features reflect Java's ongoing evolution and emphasis on performance, security, and modern programming practices.
Java 17's enhancements significantly contribute to its stature as a robust, stable, and efficient platform for developing and deploying mission-critical applications.

In addition to the major features highlighted for Java 17, several other improvements and updates are also noteworthy.
These enhancements often address specific needs that can be critical for certain applications and development environments.
Here's a detailed look at some additional changes in Java 17.

1. **Context-Specific Deserialization Filters (JEP 415)**:
   - This feature improves security by allowing applications to configure context-specific and dynamically selected deserialization filters.
     This mechanism helps prevent deserialization vulnerabilities by enabling finer control over which classes are allowed to be deserialized.
2. **Deprecations and Removals**:
   - Besides the deprecations of the Security Manager and the Applet API, Java 17 also continues the trend of cleaning up older, less-used elements of the Java ecosystem to streamline the language and focus on modern functionalities.
3. **Improved Switch Expressions**: Building on previous improvements (introduced in Java 14), switch expressions have been further refined to improve the language's consistency and usability.
4. **Always-Strict Floating-Point Semantics**:
   - Previously, developers had to opt-in to strict floating-point semantics to ensure consistent results across different platforms.
     From Java 17 onwards, these semantics are always enabled, simplifying development and testing processes.
5. **JEP 356: Enhanced Pseudo-Random Number Generators**:
   - Detailed in the main features, this JEP also provides multiple new interfaces and implementations that support not only additional algorithms but also streams of random numbers, which are useful for applications needing large quantities of random data.
6. **JEP 382: New macOS Rendering Pipeline**:
   - Beyond the performance improvements mentioned, this new pipeline also aims to ensure better integration with macOS, especially considering Apple's updates and the deprecation of older frameworks like OpenGL.
7. **Library and API Improvements**:
   - Various standard library improvements and API enhancements continue to be a part of each Java release, helping to keep the language and its capabilities modern and relevant.
8. **Tooling Updates**:
   - Updates to JDK tools and utilities to improve diagnostics, monitoring, and management capabilities, which are essential for effectively developing, debugging. and maintaining Java applications at scale.
9. **Garbage Collectors**:
   - Ongoing improvements and optimizations to garbage collection mechanisms, including G1, ZGC, and Shenandoah, to reduce pause times and handle larger heaps more efficiently.
10. **Incubator and Preview Features**:
    - Java 17 includes several incubator modules and preview features that are not yet part of the standard, but available for developers to try and provide feedback on. This is part of the ongoing process to mature these features before they become a permanent part of Java.

Java 17's release reflects a balance between introducing new functionalities and enhancing existing features while also removing outdated elements to streamline and secure the environment.
This version is designed to meet the needs of modern enterprise applications, providing a stable foundation for future development.
